    "# K最近邻(k-Nearest Neighbor，KNN)\n",
    "一种常用于分类的算法，是有成熟理论支撑的、较为简单的经典机器学习算法之一。该方法的基本思路是：如果一个待分类样本在特征空间中的k个最相似(即特征空间中K近邻)的样本中的大多数属于某一个类别，则该样本也属于这个类别，即近朱者赤，近墨者黑。显然，对当前待分类样本的分类，需要大量已知分类的样本的支持，因此KNN是一种有监督学习算法。"

    "### 优点\n",
    "① 简单，易于理解，易于实现，无需参数估计，无需训练; \n",
    "② 对异常值不敏感（个别噪音数据对结果的影响不是很大）; \n",
    "③ 适合对稀有事件进行分类; \n",
    "④ 适合于多分类问题(multi-modal,对象具有多个类别标签)，KNN要比SVM表现要好;\n",
    "### 缺点\n",
    "① 对测试样本分类时的计算量大，内存开销大，因为对每一个待分类的文本都要计算它到全体已知样本的距离，才能求得它的K个最近邻点。目前常用的解决方法是事先对已知样本点进行剪辑，事先去除对分类作用不大的样本; \n",
    "② 可解释性差，无法告诉你哪个变量更重要，无法给出决策树那样的规则; \n",
    "③ K值的选择：最大的缺点是当样本不平衡时，如一个类的样本容量很大，而其他类样本容量很小时，有可能导致当输入一个新样本时，该样本的K个邻居中大容量类的样本占多数。该算法只计算“最近的”邻居样本，某一类的样本数量很大，那么或者这类样本并不接近目标样本，或者这类样本很靠近目标样本。无论怎样，数量并不能影响运行结果。可以采用权值的方法（和该样本距离小的邻居权值大）来改进; \n",
    "④ KNN是一种消极学习方法、懒惰算法。"

    "## 步骤\n",
    "1）给定测试样本，基于某种距离度量找出训练集仲与其靠近的k个训练样本；\n",
    "2）然后基于k个“邻居”的信息进行预测，分类“投票”（k个样本中出现最多的类别标记作为预测结果）\n",
    "   回归“平均”（k个样本的实值平均值作为预测结果）\n",
    "   还可以基于距离进行加权投票或平均"
